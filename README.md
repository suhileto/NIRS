# NIRS
NIRS Data Analysis Toolbox 

Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a brain imaging method that measures light absorbance to calculate oxy-hemoglobin (oxy-HB) and deoxy-hemoglobin (deoxy-HB), which provides an indirect measure of brain activity, particularly in the frontal cortex.

This is a simple Tkinter,Pyside2 GUI toolbox which takes NIRS data in specific format (.hdr) and analyze it.
